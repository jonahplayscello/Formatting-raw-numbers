# number-conversions

hello springfield high school pltw CSE students,
I have published this code just for you,
your welcome :)

Challenge:
Formatting raw numbers
User input for all three parts

Part 1

Write a function named add_commas() that takes a non-negative integer as its only parameter.

Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousands separator.

Return the string to the main program. Print out the original number and the formatted string on the same line.

For example, calling format 1000000 to 1,000,000

Part 2

Write a function named scientifice_notation() that takes a non-negaitve number as its only parameter.

Your function should convert the number to a string and return the number in scientific notation.

In main, print out the original number and the formatted string on the same line.

For example, calling scientific_notation(1000000) should return "1 x 10^6". If necessary, round to 4 decimal places.

Part 3

Write a function named convert_currency() that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter.

Your function should conver the number to a string and return the in currency format.

In main, print out the original number and the formatted string on the same line.

For example 1098.7865 should return $1,098.78 Truncate to the nearest cent

All three functions can be part of the same program. The main part of the program will will call the functions.
